# ASTR260_HW09

Problem 1: 

run AidanWalk_HW09_1 by executing python AidanWalk_HW09_1.py. This will save a lovely plot titled "AidanWalk_HW09_1_Plot.png" in the local directory to answer a), b), and c). Euler's and Runge-Kutta method both with a step size of 25. 

Problem 2: 

a) run AidanWalk_HW09_2a by executing python AidanWalk_HW09_2a.py. This will create a plot called "AidanWalk_HW09_2a_Plot.png" in the local directory. This is an overplot of the analytic solution with RK4 over the range [0, 5] for throwing a baseball at 10m/s at a 45 degree angle with no air resistance. 

b) run AidanWalk_HW09_2b by executing python AidanWalk_HW09_2b.py. This will create a plot called "AidanWalk_HW09_2b_Plot.png" in the local directory. This plot is generated using RK4 method for the three different angles specified, each angle computed with and without drag. 
  
c) run AidanWalk_HW09_2c by executing python AidanWalk_HW09_2c.py. This will print out the maximum theoretical distance a baseball could be thrown in meters, when thrown at 108mph from a release point 2 meters off the ground.
